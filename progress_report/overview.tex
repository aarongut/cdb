\section{Overview}
\subsection{Purpose of the Report}
This report serves as an update to the reader on the progress the c0db team has
made on the C0 Debugger during the first month of work. The report will detail
what has been accomplished so far, what is in progress, what is planned for the
future, and any changes that will be made to the original plan of action. In
addition, the report will detail new literature that has been gathered and
used.
\subsection{Purpose of the Project}
The purpose of this project is to build a web application that can debug C0
code and can aid in a student's understanding of fundamental computational
models. This project will benefit students in 15-122 Principals of Imperative
Computation at Carnegie Mellon University by helping them create correct
programs. The C0 Debugger will enable students to understand how their programs
execute and find where problems originate more easily than with existing tools.
In addition to debugging, students will have better knowledge for how the
underlying computation model works when evaluating their code.
\par
The C0 Debugger will also enable students to test simple programs with little
setup, using only a web browser. They will no longer have to set up and become
familiar with a Unix environment before they can program, making C0 accessible
to more people, more quickly.
