Our goal is to build a web application that can debug c0 code.
The user will type in or upload c0 source files.
Once this is done, these files will be transferred to our server, where the cc0 compiler will be used to
generate bytecode corresponding to the user's source code.
This bytecode will be sent back to the user's web browser, where we will be running a c0 virtual machine.
The user will be able to control this virtual machine as it executes their code. 
This will give the user the ability to run their code line-by-line,
to set breakpoints, view stack traces, and see the values of variables.
By providing access to all this information, we hope to make it easier for users to write and debug c0 programs.

For version control, we will use a git repository hosted on GitHub. 
We will use a Gantt chart, shown later in this proposal, to stay on schedule.
