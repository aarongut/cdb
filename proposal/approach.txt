Approach
The approach section contains our methodology, how we plan to
implement the project, and our project schedule, the timeline we plan to adhere
to. The methodology outlines the specific tools we will use to complete the
project in a timely manner whereas the schedule outlines the deadlines by which
we hope to have certain tasks completed.

Methodology
C$_0$ Cement is a Debugger designed for the CMU teaching language,
C$_0$. It will be hosted on <BLANK> with the website itself designed in CSS and
HTML, using Node.js to run most of the core functionality. We will first deploy
a blank template website after which half of the team wil work on parsing C0
bytecode and the other half will work on creating a meaningful user experience.
Once both teams have made reasonable progress, they will combine the two units
to complete the basic outline of the project.  Project Schedule The project
will be separated into five main phases: Basic Website Design, Backend
implementation, Frontend Implementation, User Testing, and Revisions. The first
phase should take <POSSIBLY CHANGE THIS> less than a week with the next two
phases occurring simultaneously and composing the rest of the month's work.
User implementation and revisions will then hopefully take up the remainder of
the alloted time, with extra time padded in case implementation or revisions
are more extensive than we have predicted.
