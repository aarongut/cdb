Evaluation Criteria
	The goal of our website, as mentioned earlier in the proposal, is to provide a tool for 15-122 students to easily step through their C$_0$ code as a means of debugging and to gain a deeper level of understanding for the steps their code is actually taking.
	In order to evaluate our final project, we would test the product on various groups of students. Both those who have completed 15-122 in the past and those currently enrolled. Unfortunately, due to the time constraints of the project, these students will no longer actively code in C$_0$ by the time they see our product, but their interactions with it will still have been recent enough for them to provide meaningful feedback. With their feedback, we will determine how well our product succeeds at its aforementioned objectives and plan a series of modifications based on the comments we receive. We will make sure that the stepping tool and GUI are fully functional before the group testing phase so that uninformative bugs do not catch the attention of our test subjects, and they instead provide us with information to improve the user experience as a whole.
	Our main goal is to provide these students with a useful debugging tool, so their feedback is invaluable in slowly modifying our project to better suit their needs.
