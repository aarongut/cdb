This project will benefit students in 15-122 Principals of Imperative
Computation at Carnegie Mellon University by helping them create correct
programs. The C0 Debugger will enable students to understand how their programs
execute and find where problems originate more easily than with existing tools.
In addition to debugging, students will have better knowledge for how the
underlying computation model works when evaluating their code.

The C0 Debugger will also enable students to test simple programs with little
setup, using only a web browser. They will no longer have to set up and become
familiar with a Unix environment before they can program, making C0 accessible
to more people.
