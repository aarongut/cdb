\opening{Dear Mr. Keating:}

Included with this letter is our team's proposal for a browser-based debugger
for the c0 language called cdb. % Is this what we are calling it?
The purpose of the proposal is to define the need for the debugger and explain 
our plan of approach.

The proposal includes the problem addressed by our program,
explanations of prior literature and work on similar projects,
an outline of our plan for designing and implementing the program,
the intended benefits of our program,
our planned approach,
how we will evaluate our success,
and our qualifications.

If you have any further questions or comments, please contact us at
mplamann@andrew.cmu.edu.

\closing{Sincerely,}
