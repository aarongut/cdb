\opening{Dear Mr. Keating:}
\vspace{5mm}

Included with this letter is our team's final report for the browser-based
debugger for the {\tt C0} language called {\tt c0db}, the {\tt C0} Debugger.
The purpose of the report is to update you on our progress and to explain and
discuss our results.

The report describes the problem addressed by our project, our approach to
solve it, the results we were able to achieve, our challenges and struggles,
the lessons we learned throughout the progress we made, and some
recommendations on how we or another group can continue to build on our
existing platform.

If you have any further questions or comments, please contact us at one of the
following emails: shyamsur@andrew.cmu.edu, amgutier@andrew.cmu.edu.\\

Sincerely,\\[4em]
Shyam Raghavan
